# Data Analysis on How Camera Resolution Affect Memory and Battery Usage
# Abstract
The objective of this study is to observe how much effect does a mobile camera has on its battery and storage. The current
generation of smartphones more frequently uses their mobile phone, which decreases the battery life to as short as several
hours. Thus, it becomes necessary to understand the effects of different cameras on their battery and storage. How is
battery consumed across the different Megapixel Cameras Aperture? This paper presents a battery & storage study on
smartphones focusing on various brands and models. We have observed Android Mobiles of different brands and models,
tested its front as well as a back camera having distinct megapixel cameras aperture. We have observed the time taken
to drain mobile battery while continuing the recoding of the video and having camera applications on at the same time
then how much average storage of a video occupies in free memory. Previously the time taken for recording the video
was 5 min and now we will extend the time for more 5 min for further study and we will see whether memory
consumption is doubled or it goes beyond and we will also observe the battery consumption. Based on the output and
observations we have discussed and presented our conclusion
# Research Objective
* Observe the effects of mobile camera on its battery.
* Observe the amount of memory consumed after taking a video and stored in the memory.
* How does the different camera Resolutions gives the different result according to their aperture.
* To Make the analysis on the bases of gathered data and come up with an conclusion
# Methodology
This research work is based on the experiments
performed and data collected through different mobile
phones.
The method adapted was to record the video for a
descent amount of time that would give diverse results
which would make them easier to
compare and would produce more reliable
conclusion, so the video was previously shot for 5min
and now we have extended the time for more 5min by
both front and back camera of the mobile at 1080p and
60fps by the primary camera of the mobile and after
then the data such as battery % drop was recorded for
both front and back camera and made sure that while
recording the video there was no application running
in the background and the mobile data was OFF. So
that the result obtained would be purely for the camera
usage only.
The conclusion was obtained by comparing
the front and back camera of the same mobile phones,
this was done to avoid the ambiguity and hassle as the
factors such as Battery Capacity, Processor etc. were
different for different mobile which would alter the
conclusion or else would have produced less reliable
result. So, resolution impact on storage and battery
was done which were working on the same
parameters such as Battery Capacity and Processor,
the major factors for the performance of any mobile
phones
# Conclusion
From the tabulated data which was collected by the
users.
* we can say that:-Resolution impact on Storage:-
From previous Observations we found that the Higher
the resolution, Higher the storage but even we have
some mobile phones whose resolution were same but
even then they gave different sizes so on further study
we observed that for such devices the factor that led
to difference in size was the aperture of the camera
lenses.
i.e. For the lens having lesser F-stops allows more
light to pass in the camera and hence more enhanced
was the video quality which led to the difference in
video storage size as compared to that of lenses
having greater F-stop, having the same camera
resolution.
As per the previous findings we know about the
apertures are responsible for memory consumptions
And now we have also further observed by extending
the time of recordings,
If the light does not comes into the aperture the
amount of memory consumption will remain
approximately same then that of previously time taken
for recording the videos and,
If the light passes through aperture with respect to
time then the memory consumption will be higher
than previously recorded videos.

* Resolution impact on battery:-
As it was observed for higher resolution camera the
battery consumption was also high as the storage was
increased due to allowability of more light into the
camera and hence the processor needed to process
more data and consumed more battery.
We have also observed that the battery consumption
not only affects because of aperture,
it also affects because of temperature
